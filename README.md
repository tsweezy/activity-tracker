# activity-tracker

activity-tracker is a time tracking tool in which the user will manually track their daily activities throughout their day. Once the user has done enough tracking of their activities, the app will then tell the user about how they spent their time in a way which is easily digestible, understandable, and might help the user in better managing their time.
